# Use Cases

MTG-Link can be used for various local assembly use cases, such as intra-scaffold and inter-scaffold gap-fillings, as well as alternative allele reconstruction of large insertion variants.  
As users do not have the same input files depending on their use case, the `utils/` directory contains scripts to obtain the requested input GFA file from different input file formats.  
The `utils/` directory also contains scripts that merge two GFA files together or convert the output GFA file in a FASTA file. 


## Intra-scaffold gap-filling

An example of the procedure used to perform intra-scaffold gap-filling with MTG-Link is detailed [here](./intrascaffold_gapfilling/README.md).


## Inter-scaffold gap-filling

An example of the procedure used to perform inter-scaffold gap-filling with MTG-Link is detailed [here](./interscaffold_gapfilling/README.md).

## Alternative allele reconstruction of large insertion variants

An example of the procedure used to perform alternative allele reconstruction of large insertion variants with MTG-Link is detailed [here](./insertionsvariants_reconstruction/README.md).
